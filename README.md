I'm Chris. I am the Director of Machine Learning at the Wikimedia Foundation. I have worked in mission-driven technology companies and non-profits for over ten years, including disaster relief, healthcare, humanitarian aid, anti-corruption, conservation, and (now) free knowledge. I fucking love Wikipedia.

I'm probably most known for my [machine learning flashcards](https://machinelearningflashcards.com) and my book, the [Machine Learning With Python Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Python-Cookbook-Preprocessing/dp/1491989386).
