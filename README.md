## I'm Chris. I'm trying to make Wikipedia the best damn encyclopedia out there.

I am the Director of Machine Learning at the Wikimedia Foundation. I have worked in mission-driven technology companies and non-profits for over ten years, including disaster relief, healthcare, humanitarian aid, anti-corruption, conservation, and (now) free knowledge.

Previously I've created two machine learning resources, [machine learning flashcards](https://machinelearningflashcards.com) and my book, the [Machine Learning With Python Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Python-Cookbook-Preprocessing/dp/1491989386).
